# rtests
These are all the statistical tests/models we did in SAS class, 6304 and 6305.

A couple notes:
+ The way I was able to replicate the F tests for Random/Mixed Effect models is not ideal. It involves calculating the F tests by manually dividing the mean square by the interaction term. So you'll have to look up the calculation of the model's MS's in the textbook (or SAS!). It's not ideal, but it'll have to do for now!
+ I haven't explored the HOV test completely. The only example is with a simple Fixed Effect model.
